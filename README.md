This repository containts the backend of the [phonebook app](https://spooky-broomstick-18287.herokuapp.com/) created as part of the fullstackopen 2021 course.

It is created using nodeJS, expressJS and MongoDb. It has it's dedicated directory because it is hosted on heroku and cannot have a nested .git folder which will make it annoying to submit.
